# 🐟 SwapFish — The First Native DEX on Arbitrum

[View on DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocol/swapfish)

SwapFish is a Uniswap V2 fork that became the first native decentralized exchange (DEX) to launch on the Arbitrum network. Built for speed, security, and scalability, SwapFish empowers users to trade, earn, and engage in DeFi without compromise.

## 🚀 Overview

SwapFish started as the first native DEX on **Arbitrum**, offering lightning-fast, low-cost swaps and liquidity provision. As the ecosystem grew, SwapFish expanded to **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**, enabling seamless multi-chain trading.

Cross-chain interoperability was made possible via the **AnySwap Permissionless Router**, allowing assets and data to flow securely between Arbitrum and other EVM chains.
